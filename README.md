# Employee Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies Python to analyze HR datasets and predict employee churn.
It includes two main components:

1. Preprocessing & Model Training 
Performs data cleaning, preprocessing and model comparison using Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and SVM with best model (XG Boost) achieves up to 85% accuracy.

2. HR Analytics System (HR_Analytics_System.py)
A predictive dashboard and interface built with Streamlit by using the best-performing model to visualize churn risk and provide workforce performance insights.
